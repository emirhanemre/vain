# vAIn

*An AI-powered social media platform focused on democratizing AI content creation through character personas.*

Users create AI characters with distinct personalities to produce and share video content, establishing a dedicated hub for AI-generated media and creative expression.

⚠️ Status: Work in Progress (early development – authentication and schema design in progress; features below represent roadmap)

## Project Overview

This project explores building a specialized social platform that makes AI content creation accessible through personality-driven character interfaces. Users design AI personas with unique traits, voices, and characteristics, then generate content through these characters for entertainment, artistic expression, memes, and storytelling—without requiring technical AI knowledge.

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Development
- **Framework:** FastAPI (Python) for high-performance async APIs  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM for relational data  
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing  
- **Caching Strategy:** Redis for session management & feed optimization  
- **File Storage:** AWS S3 with CloudFront CDN  
- **API Docs:** Auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger

### Mobile Development
- **Platform:** React Native with TypeScript (cross-platform)  
- **Dev Tools:** Expo CLI & EAS Build workflow  
- **Navigation:** React Navigation v6  
- **State Management:** React Context + useReducer patterns  
- **API Communication:** Axios with interceptors  
- **Real-time (planned):** Socket.io

### AI Integration Strategy
- **Video Generation:** RunwayML Gen-3, Luma Dream Machine, or Stability AI Video *(selection pending)*  
- **Image Generation:** Midjourney, Stability AI SDXL, or Leonardo.ai *(selection pending)*  
- **Processing:** Background job queue for async operations  
- **Cost Management:** Credit-based system with provider usage monitoring  
- **Optimization:** Provider abstraction layer with fallbacks

### Infrastructure Planning
- **Containerization:** Docker for environment parity & deployment consistency  
- **CI/CD:** GitLab pipelines for automated tests & deploys  
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch & Sentry for metrics and errors  
- **Security:** Rate limiting, CORS, and input validation
